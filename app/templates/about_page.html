<h1>AI-Driven Threat Detection System</h1>

  <div>
    <p>
      This project is an AI-driven threat detection system designed to analyze network traffic and identify potential anomalies.
      It uses a machine learning model (<strong>Isolation Forest</strong>) to detect suspicious activities within a network by
      distinguishing between normal and abnormal traffic patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the project, the model has been trained and tested using synthetic network traffic data for anomaly detection.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      This project can be a starting point for developing more advanced network security systems. It demonstrates how machine
      learning models can be applied to network traffic data to detect potential threats in real-time.
